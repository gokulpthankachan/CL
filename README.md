## **Cycle 1 - Application problems using DFA**
  1. Design and implement a lexical analyzer using C language to recognize valid tokens 
(identifiers, keywords, operators, constants etc. . .) in the input C program. The 
lexical analyzer should ignore redundant spaces, tabs and newlines. It should also 
ignore comments. 
2. Design and implement a DFA to recognize strings defined over {a, b} that contains 
even numenr of a’s and b’s. 
3. Design and implement a DFA to recognize strings defined over {a, b} that contains 
abab as sub-string. 
4. Design and implement a DFA to recognize valid identifiers of C language. 
5. Design and implement a DFA to check whether the given decimal number is divisible 
by 3.
