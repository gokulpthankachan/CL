## **Cycle 1 - Computing Lab**
  1. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based
id3 algorithm .use an appropiate data set for building the decision tree and
apply this knowledge to classify a new sample. 
2. Write a program to implement the naive bayesian classifier for a sample
training data set stored as a .csv file.compute the accuracy of the
classifier,considering few data sets.
3. Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the naive
bayesian classifier model to perform this task. calculate the accuracy,
precision, and recall for the data set.
4. Write a program to construct a bayesian network considering medical
data.use this model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using
standard heart disease data set.you can use python ml library classes/api
5. Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use
the same data set for clustering using k-Means algorithm. Compare the
results of these two algorithms and comment on the quality of clustering.
You can add Python ML library classes/API in the program.
6. Write a program to implement k-nearest neighbour algorithm to classify
the iris dataset. print both correct and wrong predictions. python ml library
classes can be used forthis problem.
7. Write a program to implement 5-fold cross validation on a given dataset,
compare the accuracy, precision,recall,and f- score for your data set for
different folds.
8. Implement svm / softmax classifier for cifar-10 dataset:\
(i) using knn.\
(ii) using 3 layer neural network.
9. Build an artificial neural network by implementing the backpropogation
algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets.
